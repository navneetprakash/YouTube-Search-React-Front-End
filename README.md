# YouTube Search With React JS

## This is a simple YouTube Search App built with React JS. It uses the YouTube API to search for videos and display them on the page.

## Have these installed:

1. NPM
2. Node JS (tested locally on v16.5)

## Install all modules with:

`npm install`

In the project directory, you can run to start the application:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

---

## Running the build folder locally:

I have installed `serve` to run the build folder locally. You can install it with: `npm install -g serve`

Then run: `serve -s build` _the build being the folder where the files are stored_
